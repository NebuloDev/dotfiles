# KDE Theming

KDE is a very customisable DE, and capable of a lot. Unfortunately, I prefer a simple but finetuned UI, akin to Windows.

For my theming, I use two specific tools:

- Kvantum for application theming [[Arch](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/kvantum/)]
- Klassy for window decorations [[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/klassy-bin)]

The themes themselves are:

- [Fluent-kde](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Fluent-kde) (Dark Variant) as my plasma/global theme
- [Colloid-icon-variant](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Colloid-icon-theme) (Bold Dark Variant) as my icon theme
- [Fluent-gtk](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Fluent-gtk-theme) (Dark Variant) as my GTK theme
- [WinSur-dark-cursors](https://github.com/yeyushengfan258/WinSur-dark-cursors) as my cursor theme

Most of these **are** available on the [KDE Store](https://store.kde.org/browse/), and hence downloadable directly from plasma.
